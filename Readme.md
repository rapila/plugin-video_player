# Video_Player-Plugin

This Video Player-Plugin is a video player tool that works seamlessly with the external link management of [Rapila](https://github.com/rapila/cms-base)

## Goals

The Video Player-Plugin was designed with the following goals in mind:

* Easy creating of local player on website that playes various video resources
  - such as youtube, vimeo video
  â€“ displaying lists of mixed sources, such as "load video", "seekTo (go to time)", stop and play etc.
* Inspired by the a player module I started for the music band [Prankgonewrong.ch](https://www.Prankgonewrong.ch).
